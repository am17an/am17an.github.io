I'm a software developer, primarily interested in C++, performance engineering and quantative trading. 
At the moment I'm on a non-compete from my previous employer and currently immersed in learning about LLMs.

I've spent most of my career in the trading industry as Quant developer, and sometimes C++ and FPGA developer.
In my spare time I play the guitar and look at my phone.
